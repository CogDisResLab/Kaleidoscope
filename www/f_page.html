      <h1>About</h1>
      
      <p><strong>Kaleidoscope</strong> aims to be a bioinformatics pipeline for <i>in silico</i> hypothesis exploration. We curated multi-omics datasets across different databases to streamline the process of in silico data exploration of omics signatures for researchers. We utilized application programing interfaces (<strong>APIs</strong>) of many bioinformatics tools and databases and made them accessible to users under one platform with a standardized user interface. Currently, Kaleidoscope integrates data from Brain RNA-Seq, BrainCloud, BrainAtlas, BrainSpan, STRING, iLINCS, Enrichr, GeneShot, and GWAS Catalog, as well as over 200 (and counting) disease-related differential gene expression datasets. The application is designed to be user-friendly with a unified user interface, while also scalable by offering the option of uploading user-defined datasets.</p>
