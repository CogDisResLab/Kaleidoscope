## Kaleidoscope

Kaleidoscope provides easy access to several databases and tools under a unified user interface to explore research questions in silico. The web application is open-source and freely available at https://kalganem.shinyapps.io/Kaleidoscope/. This application streamlines the process of in silico data exploration for users and expands the efficient use of these tools to stakeholders without specific bioinformatics expertise.
